### Part 2 (75 pts)

*If I found an issue with the ECU firware while working at a large automotive manufacter, I would inform my boss and other team members right away with the severity and description of the problems. I would then set up a meeting to discuss the details, risks, and potential solutions. If I could, I would create tasks for this issue, prioritize it, and add it to the backlog of tasks to-do. I would try to fix as much as I could but such a complex issue would require buy-in from the entire team and management. I would not leak this sensitive information to a consumer watchdog or the public without the consent of the company. Ideally, my team members would collectively decide to fix these issues ASAP but ignoring the issue to keep the release date on track could be a possibility. Ignoring this issue may help in the short term, but has potential to cause serious accidents and death for customers, and lawsuits, fines, and a permanent reputation damange for the automotive company. I would not be willing to knowingly ship a product that has severse safety flaws. Morally, I would be personally responsible for any harm if I did not report the issue, but I would still feel personally responsible if I did nothing after the company decides to ignore this issue. As a engineer, I would have a moral responsibility to not intentionally cause any harm. If after raising all these issues the team still decides to ignore the problem, I would most likely quit the company and inform NHTSA of a potential safety violation*

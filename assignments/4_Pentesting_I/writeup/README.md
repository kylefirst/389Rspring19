## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The ```CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}``` flag was found by exploiting the command injection vulnerability on the bank's server. The flag is located in a file found in the ```home/flag.txt``` path on the server. After using Netcat to connect to the server through the open port (1337) we found in assignment 2 (```nc 1337bank.money 1337```), we find the following prompt: ```Give me a domain or IP to look up: ```. The server is looking for number as input, but because it is vulnerable to command injection, we are able to execute any additional commands separated by semicolons based on the exploit listed in Example 1 of the [OWASP article](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection). In order to find the flag, I used grep after a ip address and semicolon to recursively search for the flag filename (```192.1.1.1; grep -ir "flag" --include="*.txt"```). The file with the flag would most likely have "flag" in its name so I used "flag" as a matching parameter. I also limited the search to text files (.txt) to speed up the query. If I did not find a file, I would have used grep to search all files types instead. This resulted in the following output in Netcat showing the flag text and its location in the server: ```./home/flag.txt:CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}```. In order to prevent this vulnerability v0idcache should sanitize the inputs being sent to the server. There are two ways to sanitize inputs according to OWASP. She could replace special characters such as ```; | &&``` with safer characters such as a newline or empty space or block all user inputs with these dangerous special characters if they are not required in input. In addition to sanitizing inputs v0idcache should also ensure that user input does not execute with root or other escalated administrative privileges if not needed. With this precaution in place, hackers who do manage to break into the server or exploit a command injection vulnerability will have a harder time tampering with system critical settings and information such as passwords and user accounts.
